# AWS / Cloud Computing Notes

## What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** is the delivery of IT resources — like **servers, databases, networking, storage, software, and analytics** — over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware, companies rent computing power on demand from providers like **AWS**, **Azure**, or **GCP**.

## How Do We Know if Something is in the Cloud?

A system is considered **"in the cloud"** if it's hosted remotely and accessed over the internet, rather than stored and run on a local (**on-premises**) server.

- **On-prem**: The organisation physically manages its own servers and infrastructure in-house  
- **Cloud**: The infrastructure is managed externally and accessed via the internet

## Popular Cloud Services & Their Uses

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** – Offers a wide range of services including virtual machines (EC2), storage (S3), and serverless tools (Lambda)  
- **Microsoft Azure** – Often used by enterprises due to strong Windows integration and hybrid cloud support  
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** – Known for data, analytics, and AI capabilities (e.g. BigQuery, Vertex AI)

## Four Cloud Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud** – Shared services delivered over the internet (e.g. AWS, Azure)  
- **Private Cloud** – Dedicated infrastructure for one organisation  
- **Hybrid Cloud** – Mix of public and private for flexibility  
- **Multi Cloud** – Use of multiple public cloud providers

## Three Main Types of Cloud Services

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – Provides virtualised computing resources (e.g. EC2)  
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – Development tools and environments (e.g. Heroku, App Engine)  
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)** – Software delivered over the internet (e.g. Google Workspace, Zoom)

## Advantages of Cloud Computing

- **Scalable** – Adjust resources based on demand  
- **Cost-effective** – No upfront hardware costs  
- **Accessible** – Work from anywhere with internet  
- **Faster deployment** – Launch and update apps quickly  
- **Managed services** – Maintenance like backups and updates handled for you

## Disadvantages / Risks

- **Downtime** – If the provider has issues  
- **Security concerns** – Data privacy and compliance  
- **Vendor lock-in** – Hard to migrate  
- **Costs** – Can increase over time if not managed properly

## Cloud Market Share (2024)

- **AWS** – Largest market share  
- **Azure** – Strong in enterprise environments  
- **GCP** – Known for data and AI tools  

These are known as **The Big Three**.

## Which Cloud Provider is Best?

It depends:

- **AWS** – Broadest range of services  
- **Azure** – Good for Microsoft-heavy organisations  
- **GCP** – Strong in analytics and machine learning

## What Do You Usually Pay For?

- **Compute** – e.g. EC2, Lambda  
- **Storage** – e.g. S3, Blob Storage  
- **Networking** – Data transfer, bandwidth  
- **Managed services** – Databases, monitoring, security

## Four Pillars of DevOps (and How They Link to Cloud)

- **Collaboration** – Cloud tools support remote teamwork  
- **Automation** – CI/CD and infrastructure as code  
- **Continuous Improvement** – Easy to roll out updates  
- **Customer Feedback** – Cloud enables faster iteration based on feedback
